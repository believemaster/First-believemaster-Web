# First-believemaster-Web
This is My very first static Html web page I made when I started learning Development.

## Deployed Here:
http://www.believemaster.rf.gd
Yaya ikr it's deployed on a free hosting server.

## Languages used
A noobs Language i.e. HTML and some CSS for giving up look and feel better and some carousel stuff using this JavaScript thing.

## Purpose
The purpose of doing this was just to get into my development and getting hands on with this poor language and get dirty with that and 
start my development cycle from level 0.
You can use my template if you want to and look through the lines i wrote.

# ThankYou
